# Practical Skills

# Vocabulary

- Meniscus: 凹液面最低处
- Spirit level: 水平仪

# Data logger

- High sampling rate.
- Optional
   - Can be logged over a **longer** time period than a person could do.
   - Change too fast but time too short. Reducing reaction time.
   - No parallax error.
   - Can take different readings **simultaneously.**
   - Idea that data logger store the results.

# Video camera

- Motion can be viewed in a slower speed. Effect of reaction time can be reduced
- It can be paused.
- The graph can zoom in.
- Help judge when the reaction / motion completes / stops.

# Light gate

- Eliminate reaction time.
- No parallax error, it is in a fixed position.

# Measure length of xx

- Put the ruler meter as close as possible.
- Use set square / spirit level to make sure it is horizontal / vertical.
- Use a set square to read.
- Check for reading zero.
- View meter rule perpendicularly.

# The relationship between X and Y

- Measuring nT and divide by n.
- Repeat and take average.
- Start after several xx (period / time).
- Take at least 5 pairs of reading.
- Plot a graph of XX against XX, gradient is XX, it is a straight line.

# Measure period

- Measuring nT and divide by n.
- Repeat and take average.
- Use a timing marker at the centre of oscillation.
- Start after several oscillation.

# Criticise the results (Why conclusion is not correct)

- Only n sets of results.
- No repeats shown.
- Too small range.
- Inconsistent data / s.f. d.p. / interval / unit

# Water bath, change of temperature θ

- Stir the water, to ensure its in same temperature.
- Put thermometer close xx.
- Cover the xx to reduce energy lose.

# How to measure data

- Same interval

> For diode

- Take as many as possible around the changing point

# Calculating the final velocity

- Using 3 rubber bond, measuring 2 separate velocity, compare the velocity it gets. we can know whether it is final velocity

# Uncertainty

## Why uncertainty is 1mm?

- The uncertainty of a single reading is half the resolution of the meter rule.
- As the two **readings** are subtracted, the uncertainties are added.

## The major uncertainty

It need time for the human to react

# Valid, precise and accurate

Valid: Being ale to work

Precise: 离散程度，依赖于 range

Accurate: 准确程度

# 3 errors

- Systematic error: check for zero error
- Random error: repeat and take average, cannot read two values simultaneously.
- Anomaly error: draw a plot

# Oscilloscope

- Trace with fixed position (maximum amplitude).
- Count the number of **divisions** between first and last peaks.
- Multiply by the time per division.
- Time divide by n to calculate the average time.
