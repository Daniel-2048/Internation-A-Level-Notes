# Simple harmonic motion

The **resultant** force is proportional to the **displacement** from equilibrium position and always point towards to the equilibrium position.

The force is called the **restoring** force.

A is amplitude, $$\omega$$ is angular speed

$$
v=\frac{dx}{dt}
$$

$$
x=A sin (\omega t + \phi) \newline
a=-\omega^2 x
$$

$$
v_{max}=A\omega \newline
a_{max}=A\omega^2
$$

k is the **restoring** constant, NOT stiffness constant.

According to the following formulae, the T actual is a constant

$$
T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \newline
T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}
$$

# Resonance and damping

## Free oscillation

Natural frequency, No **periodic** force

Forced oscillations: driving frequency

## Resonance 共振

Anything refers to music or sounds should used resonance as a justification because the frequency changes with time.

When the **driving frequency** is equal or near to the natural frequency, there is a maximum energy transfer, causing maximum amplitude. That time the energy loss is the minimal.

## Damped oscillation 阻尼振動

There is energy transfer from the oscillation system to the surroundings, causing a decrease in amplitude.

Put a **timing marker** on the centre of oscillation, there may be damping, but it must pass through oscillation centre.

Underdamp: the amplitude is **exponential** decrease. 指數級的下降

Overdamping: the oscillation stopped in one cycle.

Critical damped: the quickest time taken for the amplitude to reduce to 0.
