x against t^2 graph: A line passes through the origin.

People with epilepsy or migraine may be adversely affected by multi-flash photography.

# Adding forces

## Scale drawing

We use ::protractor:: (量角器) to draw vector diagram to calculate the resultant force.

resultant force <-> component force

## Free-body diagrams

上下的力长度相等，左右的力长度也想等

# Moments

The turning effect

$$
Moment=force \times perpendicular\ distance\ from\ the\ pivot\ to\ the\ line\ of\ action\ of\ the\ foce
$$

## Centre of gravity

The point through the weight of an object appears to act. 物體的重量所產生的力點。

The centre of gravity of a uniform thing appears on the symmetry of line. 均勻物體的重心出現在對稱線上。

## How to draw a plot

### Plot a graph

1. 只有1, 2, 5, 10的倍数可以。
2. 原点可以不为零。
3. x-axis & y-axis。
4. Scale should be proper one。

## First law

Change in velocity is 0, when the resultant force is 0

$$
\Sigma F=0\ \Delta a=0
$$

## Second law

$$
\Sigma F=ma
$$

### Practical skills

Light gate won’t appears alone. It is used to calculate the time.

The total mass should be fixed, they are accelerating together, so every time you want to change the force acting on the car, you need to move trolley from one end to another.

Acceleration against force graph or Acceleration against 1 / m graph. A is inversely proportional to B.

## Third law

When an object A causes a force on another object B, the B will causes an equal force in the opposite direction to act upon A.

- Equal
- Opposite
- Same type
- Same time of action
- Same line of action

### Why xx is (not) Newton's third law?

- This is xx law
- Definition of xx law
- Definition and characteristics of the force
- The force reacting on the object
- The resultant force is xx.

# Projectile

## The trajectory of the projectiles 轨迹

When in the air, the thing feels only a downward weight. Horizontal motion / velocity is independent of vertical motion. Horizontally, the vertical feels no force, so it moves at a constant velocity.

# Gravitational potential and kinetic energies 重力潛能和動能

## Kinetic energy

$$
E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

$$
y \propto mx^2 \\ A\ is\ proportional\ to\ x^2
$$

## Why there are repeating records

- an average can be taken
- random outliers can be identified.

## Why drawing graph

- identify the system error
- show the outliers

## Valid / accurate / precious

# Work and power

$$
W=F \cdot s=mg\Delta h
$$

# Momentum

$$
p(momentum)=m\cdot v
\\unit:\ kg\cdot m\cdot s^{-1}
$$

Resultant force is proportional to the change in momentum.

# Conservation of linear momentum 線性動量守恆

Total momentum of the system remains constant before and after the collision, in a closed system, no external force. 碰撞前後系統的總動量保持不變。沒有提供外力。

## Explosion 爆炸

A situation in which a stationary object separates into component parts. 一個靜止的物體分離成組成部分的情況。
