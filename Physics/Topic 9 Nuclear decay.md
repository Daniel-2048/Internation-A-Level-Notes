# Nuclear radiation

Hydrogen: $$^1H$$. Deuterium: $$^2H$$. Tritium: $$^3H$$

## Background radiation

It is necessary to **calculate** background radiation in **experiments**.

The background radiation is not constant, the more sensitive **detector** will capture more radiation.

| Radiation         | lonising power | Penetrating power | Example of range in air | Radiation stopped by |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| alpha, $$\alpha$$ | strong         | weak              | 5~8 cm                  | paper                |
| beta, $$\beta$$   | moderate       | moderate          | 500~1000 cm             | thin (any) aluminium |
| gamma, $$\gamma$$ | weak           | strong            | virtually infinite      | thick lead sheet     |

## Types of nuclear radiation

The background radiation should be in consideration.

### Alpha decay

The nuclear of the $$He^{2+}$$

### Beta decay

More neutrons: $$\beta ^-$$

More protons: $$\beta ^+$$

$$
^{14}_6C \rightarrow ^{14}_7 N +^0_{-1} \beta+\overline{V}
$$

#### Some radiation product still be radioactive

- An indication of increased / greater activity (from bismuth) 從鉍增加/活躍的跡象
- Due to presence of beta particles (as Alpha particles cannot **penetrate** the bean plant)

### Gamma decay

It is a kind of wave, which cannot be detected through ionisation.

# Rate of radioactive decay

The activity of a radioactive source: the **rate** of decay of nuclei

Radioactive decay is a **spontaneous** and **random** process.

Random: can not say which **nuclear** will decay next, can not say when will next nuclear will decay.

Spontaneous: can not be **influenced**

Activity: the unit is **Bq**, number per second

N: the total molecule number of nuclei

$$
A=-\lambda N
$$

$$
N=N_0e^{-\lambda t} \newline
A=A_0e^{-\lambda t}
$$

## Half-life

The **average** time taken for half of the nucleus to decay.

$$
t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{ln2}{\lambda}
$$

### Precautions for calculating the half-life

- Using long **tons**, as distance increase activity decrease.
- Wearing **shielding**, as it can absorb radiation.
- Decreasing exposure time, as ionising effect is **cumulative**.

# Fission and fusion

## Fission

The splitting of a large nucleus into smaller **nuclei**, releasing energy

### How it produce energy

The mass of the (fission) **fragments** is less than the mass of the original nucleus, $$\Delta E = \Delta m c^2$$.

## Fusion

Small **nuclides** combine together to make larger nucleus, releasing energy.

## Energy-mass equivalence

High energy may used to produce higher mass.

1 unified atomic mass

Mass **defect** $$\Delta $$m shows that when one nucleus is formed by the proton and electrons, the total mass of it will decrease

## Nuclear binding energy 結合能

The energy released to hold the nucleus together. The energy needed to absorb to **break** a nucleus **apart** into its **individual** **nucleons**.

## Binding energy per nucleon 單位核子結合能

The higher nuclear binding energy per nucleon, the more stable it is. $$Fe$$ has the largest binding energy per nucleon.

The binding energy per nucleon increase, it will release the energy. Otherwise it will absorb. NO RELATIONSHIP between fission & fusion and energy releasing.

### Total binding energy magnitude

- One nucleon: Fusion
- Total energy from graph: Fission
- Same mass of nucleons: Fusion

## The necessary condition for the fusion

- High temperature shows high average **kinetic energy** to overcome the electrostatic repulsive force in order to let the nuclei come **close** enough to let fusion happen.
- Gravitational force produce a very high density to maintain high **collision rate** to sustain fusion.

## The advantages of nuclear fusion comparing to the nuclear fission, and why humans do not use nuclear fusion

- No radioactive waste.
- Hydrogen fuel for fusion **virtually** unlimited **source**.
- High energy density.
- Extremely high temperature is hard to **reach**.
- No container, if use container, the fusion will **cease**.
- If use electric magnetic field, it will **consume** too much energy.

### Fusion advantages

- Hydrogen fuel for fusion is virtually unlimited. Fission relies upon a relatively limited resource.
- Fusion results in few radioactive products. Radioactive products produced in fission present significant storage problems.
- For a given mass of fuel, the energy released by fusion is greater than the energy released by fission.
