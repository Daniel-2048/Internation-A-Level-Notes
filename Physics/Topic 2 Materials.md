# Fluid, density and upthrust 流體、密度和浮力

## Upthrust

It's necessary to draw upthrust.

Upwards force caused by the fluid pressure.

**Upthrust is equal to weight of the fluid that has been displaced by the object.** 浮力等於物體所排除的液體重量。

## The Hydrometer 密度计

Using the Archimedes’ principle.

# Fluid movement

The streamlined in shape can reduce the air resistance. 流線型的形狀可以減少空氣阻力。

## Turbulent flow & Laminar flow 紊流和層流

For laminar flow, the layers won’t mix

For turbulent flow, the speed and direction of flow will have a abrupt change.

- The barrier should be a **stream line** in shape
- Small, slow, smooth, sphere.
- The relative velocity should not be that large, otherwise a turbulent flow will exists.

# Viscosity 黏性

$$
F=6\pi \eta rV
\\V\ is\ relative\ velocity
$$

A small sphere moving slowly in a fluid (Lamina flow only)

As temperature increases, the viscosity decreases (except gas)

## Water bath

Equipments: Bunsen burner

# Terminal velocity

The resultant force is zero, the acceleration is 0, the constant velocity is the terminal velocity. The air resistance increase until it reached a balance

## The motion process

Initially, the acceleration is maximum, the downward resultant force is max. As the velocity increases, the resistance force increases, too. When the drag and the upthrust is equal to the weight, the sphere will have a constant velocity. 最初，加速度是最大的，向下的合力也是最大的。隨著速度增加，阻力也會增加。當阻力和浮力等於重量時，球體將保持恆定速度。

$$
W_f=m_fg+6\pi \eta rV_{term}\
\\\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\rho_s g\ (weight)=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\rho_f g\ (upthrust)+6 \pi \eta rV_{term}
$$

Using the formula above we can know the expression of V term

$$
V_{term}=\frac{2r^2g(\rho_s-\rho_f)}{9 \eta}
$$

# Soils material properties

## Hooke’s Law

The extension is ::proportional:: ::to:: force.

## Hysteresis 磁滯現象

The spring can go back to the original length, but not immediately after unloading the poise. Some of the energy is ::dissipated 浪費掉的::

# Stress, strain and the young modulus

$$
\sigma\ (Stress)=\frac{F\ (froce)}{A\ (cross-sectional area)}
\\\epsilon\ (Strain)=\frac{\Delta X\ (extension)}{X\ (original\ length)}
\\E\ ( Young\ modulus)=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$$

## ::Tensile:: stress and compressive stress 拉伸應力和壓縮應力

make the material longer / shorter

## How can we measure the young modulus

To calculate the stress, strain

- Force: The weight the ::poise:: provided. 力：天平提供的重量。
- Diameter: Use the ::micrometer screw:: to calculate the diameter. Because the resolution of micrometer screw is about 0.01mm, can reduce the ::uncertainty::. Then we can calculate the cross-sectional area A. 直徑：使用千分尺螺絲來計算直徑。因為千分尺螺絲的解析度約為0.01毫米，可以減少不確定性。然後我們可以計算截面積A。
- Original length: Using meter rule to calculate the length of the original length. 原始長度：使用米尺來計算原始長度。
- Add masses. 添加質量。
- Measure the new length.
- The extension then can be known. **The largest percentage uncertainty appears here.** 然後可以知道伸展程度。**最大百分不確定性出現在這裡。**
- Add more masses, then repeat the steps above. 再添加更多質量，然後重複上述步驟。
- Draw a graph. 畫一張圖表。
- The young modulus can be calculate
