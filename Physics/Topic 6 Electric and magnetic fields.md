# Electric fields

Gravitational field / Magnetic field

Electric field: a region of space that will cause charged particles to experience a force.

## Electric field force

> Premise: Electric field is radial. It is a **point** **charge**.

$$
\\F=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{r^2}
$$

## Electric field strength

### Definition

It shows the field strength around it. E: V/m, F: N, Q: C

$$
E=\frac{F}{Q}
$$

### For calculating

$$\epsilon$$ is called the ***permittivity of free space**.* It is for the point / charge / **radial field** only

$$
E=\frac{Q (自身电荷)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}=\frac{kQ}{r^2}
$$

## Energy

### Electric potential difference energy

$$
E=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{r}
$$

### Electric potential

V is called potential difference, it's scalar.

$$
V=\frac{E}{Q}=\frac{kQ(自己的电荷)}{r}
$$

# Uniform field

V is potential difference and d is the distance between two plates.

$$
E=\frac{V}{d}
$$

# Magnetic field

Magnetic flux density B, the number of magnetic flux in a unit area.

$$
B(T)=\frac{\Phi(Wb)}{A}
$$

Flux linkage = $$n\Phi$$

## Force on wire

The formulae below is called Fleming's Left Hand Rule, abbreviated as **FLHR**. ^265C8338-FEC0-4EF4-9D6E-F9AF41DD6C03

$$
F=BIL
$$

## Force on particles

Charged particles moving in a magnetic field follow a **circular** path.

$$
F=Bv(drift\ velocity)q
$$

# Generating electricity

Magnetic flux changing will cause the generating of the electricity.

There is a change in magnetic flux linkage, induce an e.m.f.

$$\epsilon$$ is e￼.m.f

$$
\epsilon=-\frac{\Delta N\Phi}{\Delta t(Period)}=NBA \omega
$$

## Lenz's law

The direction of an induced e.m.f. is such as to oppose the change creating it.

The current in the coil produces a magnetic field to oppose the motion, so there is a force on the magnetic in the opposite direction.

## Faraday's law

$$\frac{\Delta N\Phi}{\Delta t}$$ is faraday's law states that the induced e.m.f. is proportional to the rate of **change** of flux linkage.

## The induced e.m.f. graph by the free fall magnet

- Changing of magnetic field.
- Induced e.m.f. proportional to rate of change of flux linkage.
- Initial increase in e.m.f. as the magnet gets closer to the coil.
- Negative gradient when magnet going through the coil
- Magnet's speed increases as it falls
- Negative (max) value > Positive (max) value
- Time for second pulse shorter
- The areas of the two parts of the graph will be the same (since $$N\Phi$$ constant)

## How the coil generate the electricity when rotating in the magnetic field ?

### General situation

- There is a changing magnetic flux linkage, there is an alternating magnetic field
- Inducing an e.m.f..
- Generating a current because there is a closed circuit

### The maximum or minimal induced e.m.f on the graph

- When the coil is horizontal: The flux linkage is zero so any movement will lead to decrease / increase
- When the coil is vertical: The flux linkage is maximum and slight movement of the coil will lead lo very little change.

### One coil changes lead to the changing of another

- Current in primary produces a magnetic field
- When switch opened (the current in primary falls) and there is a change in magnetic flux linkage in the secondary **Or** When switch opened (the Current in primary falls) and lines of flux cut the secondary coils
- E.m.f. is induced

## Transformer 變壓器

- **Alternating** p.d. produces alternating current in **input coil**.
- A **varying** magnetic field in **input coil**.
- There is a change in magnetic flux linkage with **second** coil, so e.m.f induced.
- Complete circuit, so current in circuit.
- Diode produces direct current.

## Speaker

- Varying current produce a varying magnetic field.
- The magnetic field interact with the magnet.
- There is force on **cone**.
- The direction of magnetic field change with current change.
- The cone vibrates to produce sounds

# Capacitor Basics

Capacitor an electrical circuit **component** that stores charge, which can be used as an energy store.

Electrons move from one plate to another. When capacitor is fully charged, there is no movement.

$$
Capacitance(F)=\frac{Charge\ stored(C)}{Potential\ difference\ across\ capacitor(V)} \newline
C=\frac{Q}{V}
$$

## Energy stored

$$
E=\frac{1}{2}QV=\frac{1}{2}CV^2
$$

## Charging and discharging capacitors

It discharges **exponentially**.

Fig B (a) is because of the repulsion increases and the potential difference decreases.

# Capacitor mathematics

t is time, R is the total resistance, C is capacitance.

When every $$t=RC$$ past, the Q is become $$\frac{1}{e}$$, this t is called time constant, using the $$\tau$$

$$
Q=Q_0e^{\frac{-t}{RC}}
$$
