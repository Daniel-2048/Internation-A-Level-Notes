# Experiments Precautions 预防措施

## Masses

hazard 安全风险

Place a collecting box with crumple paper under the dropping zone, sponge (海绵) is also a good choice.

## Metal wires

It may break.

We need to wear goggles.

## Liquid

The liquid may splash, what may cause slippery (飞溅), DON’T FORGET TO MOP UP (擦干净) IT !

## High Voltage

Electric shock (触电), shroud (包裹) the connections.

# Stress-Strain Graph

$$
Stress\ \sigma=\frac{Force\ F}{Cross\ sectional\ Area\ A}
\\Strain=\frac{extension\ \Delta\ x}{original\ length\ x}
$$

## Hooke’s law

$$
F=k\Delta x
