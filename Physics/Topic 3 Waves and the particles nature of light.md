# Wave basics

Wave: a means of transferring energy.

Wavelength: the distance between a point on a wave and the same point on the next cycle of the wave.

Crest 波峰 / trough 波谷

Amplitude: the magnitude of maximum displacement reached by an resting position in the wave. 振幅：波浪中達到最大位移的靜止位置的大小。A: m

Period: the time taken to finish one oscillation. T: s

Phase: 2π rad

Frequency: the number of complete wave cycles per second 頻率：每秒完整波循環的次數

$$
wave\ speed=wavelength\times frequency
\\v=\lambda f
$$

## Practical skills

The difference between two peaks is the time taken to travel from mic 1 to mic 2.

## Pulse-echo measurements

The shortest length can be measured is the half length of the pulse. 最短的長度可以測量是脈衝的一半長度。

### Why we use pulse to measure the length?

- To **distinguish** received pulse (reflected pulse) from **transmitted pulse** 區分接收的脈衝（反射的脈衝）與傳輸的脈衝
- Time interval can be measured
- One pulse must return before the next is sent 下一個脈衝發送前必須返回一個脈衝。

## How the sound travels in the materials

- The sound causes the vibrations of the xx molecules.
- The vibrations parallel to the direction of wave transfers.
- Producing compressions and **rarefactions**. 產生壓縮和稀薄。

## Seismic waves 地震波

- Primary wave: longitudinal waves
- Secondary wave: transverse waves

## Factor of effecting sounds

T (N): tension

μ (Kg/m): linear density (线密度): mass per unit length

$$
v=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
\\f=\frac{1}{\lambda} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
$$

# Wave phase and superposition

## Superposition

![Image.png](Topic%203%20Waves%20and%20the%20particles%20nature%20of%20light.assets/Image%20(2).png)

When two waves meet, the overall displacement at a point is the vector sum of the displacement caused by each individual wave at that point. 當兩個波浪相遇時，某一點的整體位移是該點上每個單獨波浪引起的位移之向量和。

## Coherent waves 相幹波

- Constant phase difference.
- Same frequency

# Stationary Waves

[[Topic 3 Waves and the particles nature of light#Coherent waves 相幹波]]

Cannot transfer energy.

Oscillation in a fixed space with regions with maximum oscillation and no oscillation.

## How is stationary wave produced?

When 2 waves meet, they superpose, if path different is nλ, they are in phase, constructive interfere happens, producing point with maximum amplitude called antinode. If path different is (n+1/2) λ, they are in anti-phase, destructive interference happens, producing point which have zero amplitude called node.

# Diffraction 衍射

Diffraction: when a wave passes through a gap, the wave energy **spreads** **out**. 當波通過物體附近或穿過縫隙時，會發生衍射現象，波能量會擴散開來。

When the wave length is equal to the length of gap, it will have largest diffraction.

## Diffraction grating

### How to let the theta greater?

- move the screen further
- decrease d

# Polarisation

It only oscillates in a single direction which is perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

It only oscillates in a **single** plane which **includes** perpendicular to the **plane** of propagation.

## Q & A

### 兩片偏振片後沒有光

When the light passes through the first filter, it becomes a polarised light, the intensity reduce to 1/2 of it. The oscillation only occurs in one direction that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. When the polarising filter is rotated in one direction, no light passes through the filter because only one direction of oscillation of light can pass, resulting in the absence of light.

### 一片偏振片沒有光

The original light is polarised, and when the polarising filter is rotated in one direction, no light passes through the filter, resulting in the absence of light.

### 從水面來的光能看到魚

The reflection can polarise the light and it is perpendicular to the polarised filter. The light from fish is not perpendicular to that.

## Polarised light

Oscillations occurs in one planes. The polarised plane is where the electric field oscillates. 振盪發生在一個平面上。偏振的平面是電場進行振動的地方。

## Polarising filter / Polaroid

Glare: It is used to reduce the reflection, which is mostly horizontally polarised. 眩光：它用於減少反射，主要是水平偏振的。

## Use polarisation to calculate the concentration

$$
I=\frac{P}{A}=\frac{W}{m^2}
$$

![Image.png](Topic%203%20Waves%20and%20the%20particles%20nature%20of%20light.assets/Image%20(4).png)

We use two polarisation filter and show the angle the second polarisation filter rotates. Then we can find a formula between the concentration and the angle.

# Wave-particle duality 波粒二象性

## What show that the light is a wave?

- Diffraction, interference
- Polarising

\\ Plank\ constant=6.63 \times 10^{-34}Js

Light has particle property

Ionisation: a property of electron

## Huygens' principle 惠更斯原理

The basic idea is to consider that any and every point on the wavefront is a new source of circular waves travelling forwards from that point. 基本思想是考慮到波前上的每一個點都是從該點向前傳播的圓形波浪的新源。

這個基本原理解釋了衍射和波能量的傳播

> Safety Note: Do not view ultraviolet light directly or by reflection to avoid retinal damage. If electroscope is charged with a high voltage connection, use a safe connection method to avoid electric shock.

The emission of electrons occurs immediately / instantaneously.

Work function: the minimum energy needed by an electron at the surface of a metal to escape from the metal 工作函數：金屬表面的電子逃脫所需的最小能量

**Threshold** frequency the minimum frequency of electromagnetic radiation that can cause the emission of photoelectrons from the metal 閾值頻率是能夠引起金屬發射光電子的最低電磁輻射頻率。

## Why wave duality is not true / *particle duality is true*?

- Minimum / threshold frequency required to release electrons. 釋放電子所需的最低/閾值頻率。
- For waves, any frequency would be able to release electrons. 對於波而言，任何頻率都能釋放出電子。
- Release of electrons is instantaneous. 釋放電子是瞬間的。
- If the wave model were correct, (energy) would take time to build up before electrons were released. 如果波模型是正確的，那麼（能量）在電子釋放之前需要時間才能積累。
- (Kinetic) energy of released electrons dependent on frequency. 釋放的電子的（動能）能量取決於頻率。
- If the wave model were correct, the (kinetic) energy of the released electrons would be dependent on the intensity. 如果波動模型是正確的，釋放電子的（動能）將取決於強度。
- *One electron absorb one photon. 一個電子吸收一個光子。*

## De Broglie equation

$$
\lambda=\frac{h \ (Planck's\ constant)}{p\ (momentum)}
$$

# Atomic electron energy

## Electronic energy level

Energy level: An allowed / possible / specific / discrete quantity of energy for （an electron in） the atom 原子中（電子的）允許 / 可能 / 特定 / 離散能量的數量

Ground state: the lowest energy level for a system, for example, when all the electrons in an atom are in the lowest energy levels they can occupy, the atom is said to be in its ground state 基態是系統的最低能量水平，例如，當原子中的所有電子都處於它們可以占據的最低能量水平時，該原子被稱為處於基態。

### Why some of the certain light is gone

Electrons absorb energy and **excited** to higher energy level and de-excited to lower energy level and emit energy with the form of photon. $$E = hf = \Delta energy$$ are **discrete** and **specific**, so difference in energy level is discrete, so only corresponding and certain Frequency and wavelength of light. 電子吸收能量並激發到較高的能級，然後退回到較低的能級並以光子形式釋放能量。E=hf=能級之間的差異，能級是離散和具體的，因此能級差也是離散的，所以只有相對應和確定頻率與波長的光線。
