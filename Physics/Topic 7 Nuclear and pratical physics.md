## Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom

Negative electrons are **scattered** through a positive **dough**.

The electrons will just pass through if the structure is like that.

## Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom

A large amount of charge and most of the mass is concentrated in a tiny central nucleus. Most of the atom is empty space, and electrons orbit at the edge.

### Why plum-pudding model is not correct

- Most alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil or deflected by small angles.
- Either model would predict small or zero deflections because in the nuclear model the atom is mostly empty space and in the 'pudding' model matter is too **spread out**.
- Some of particles are deflected through a large angle and a few proportion of alpha particles were deflected back towards the source side.
- This did not fit the plum pudding model as this deflection requires a high concentration of charge.
- A few proportion of alpha particles were deflected back towards the source side.
- These did not fit the plum pudding model as this deflection requires a high concentration of mass.

# Electrons from atoms

## Photoelectric effect

Electrons are released from a metal surface because it is hit by the **electromagnetic** radiation.

When particle shows the characteristics of the waves. It is used as [[Topic 7 Nuclear and pratical physics#Structure / Probe]] to show the internal structure.

For a photon, $$E=hf$$ is used for calculation.

## Thermionic emissions

The **release** of electrons from a metal surface caused by heating of the metal.

Idea that electrons accelerated by electric field produced by charge on the **anode**.

# Particle accelerators

## Linear accelerator

- Electric field accelerates [particle] across **gaps**
- Potential difference oscillates at a constant frequency so the time in the gaps is constant for each cycle
- Enters successive gaps at greater speeds so the gaps must increase in size
- [Particle] has constant **speed** within the **drift** tube
- Potential difference oscillates at a constant frequency so time in tubes is constant for **each** cycle
- Goes faster in successive tubes so the tubes must increase in length.

### One special condition: relativistic effect occurs

- Speed of particles is near the speed of light
- Additional energy increases **mass**, as relativistic effect happens.
- The idea that the alternating accelerating p.d. is **synchronised** (同步) with the passage of the electrons from one tube to the **next**.
- Time and spent in each drift tube is **constant** (so length must be constant)

## Cyclotron

$$
r=\frac{mv}{Bq}
$$

r: radius, m: mass, v: velocity, B: magnetic flux density

$$\times$$ in, $$\cdot$$ out

### How it works

- Particles accelerated by electric field between the **dees**.
- The magnetic field is perpendicular to particle motion
- This causes a centripetal force for a **circular** path
- The p.d has **reversed** when the [particle] reaches the gaps again.
- The time for particle in a dee remains constant.
- **Path** of the [particle] has a larger radius with greater **speed**.

# Particle detectors

## Structure / Probe

High energy electrons will have large momentum, $$\lambda = h/p$$, so have small wavelength, so wavelengths have approximately the same size as nucleons.

$$
\lambda=\frac{h}{p}
\\p=mv
$$

## Bubble chamber

1. Choose any point on the track
2. Using [[Topic 6 Electric and magnetic fields#^265C8338-FEC0-4EF4-9D6E-F9AF41DD6C03]] to determine the direction of force
3. Determine whether the moving direction and the direction of the current is the same. If same, it is positive particle, otherwise it is negative particle.

The magnitude of **curvature** shows the magnitude of the radius and then shows the moving direction.

# Particle interactions

## How the conservation of momenta affect the qualitative transformation？

Total momenta before collision is not zero. More energy transfer to kinetic energy.

## Annihilation 煙滅

The energy cannot be destroyed or produced through. The particles produces are always in **pairs** and mostly in **same generation**.

m: total mass

$$
E=mc^2
\\\frac{E}{C^2}=m
$$

This reaction is known as electron-positron pair production.

4 Conservations: **Charge** conservation, **baryon** conservation, **lepton** conservation and **strangeness** conservation

## Strangeness

Each strange quark has a strangeness of -1. Anti-strange quark has a strangeness of 1.
