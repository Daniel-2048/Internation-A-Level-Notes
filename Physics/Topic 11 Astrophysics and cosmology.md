## Stefan-Boltzmann law

$$
L=\sigma AT^4
$$

$$L$$ is **luminosity** aka the energy of stars, $$A$$ is area, $$T$$ is the surface temperature.

## Wien's law

$$
\lambda_{max}T=2.898 \times 10^{-3}mK
$$

### Black body

No radioactive reflected, absorbing radioactive, releasing radioactive.

Massive main sequence stars will have greater gravitational force, so **rate** of fusion is greater, which results in higher temperature on surface.

## The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram

### Main sequence star

A stable star whose c**ore** performs hydrogen fusion and produce mostly helium.

## Why this graph is sun

Peak wavelength ($$\lambda_{max}$$) is in the middle of the visible region of the electromagnetic **spectrum**.

## Star evolution

- Nebula
- The central density of protostar continuously increases.
- The star is fusing hydrogen in its core.
- The star reach a dynamic equilibrium.
- When fusion ceases, the core **collapses**.
- The star becomes a red giant.
- This happens first for stars near the top of the main sequence.
- Red giant stars are located above the main sequence.
- Temperature is high enough for helium fusion to begin.
- Helium begins to run out and then fusion ceases.
- The star becomes a white dwarf.
- White dwarf are located below the main sequence
- Red giant stars are larger and have a lower temperature.

### Sun-like stars

The central density of **protostar** continuously increases and then the fusion happens. The mass converts to the energy. The hydrogen begins to fusion that time. The outer surface crashes and flies. These things form planets and moons. The star can reach a dynamic equilibrium. The amount of expanding is equal to that of collapsing. When hydrogen fusion ends main sequence star **evolve** into red giant star. The star begin to **collapse**. The helium will fusion. Large energy releases. The shell totally crashes. The temperature decrease. When helium fusion ends it evolves into planetary nebulae. These scattered fragments form **planetary** **nebulae**. Then it forms white dwarfs.

### Blue supergiant

The central density of **protostar** continuously increases and then the fusion happens. The mass converts to the energy. The hydrogen begins to fusion that time. The outer surface crashes and flies. These things form planets and moons, the star can reach a dynamic equilibrium. The amount of expanding is equal to that of collapsing. When hydrogen fusion ends main sequence star **evolve** into red super giant star. The star begin to **collapse**. The helium will fusion. Large energy releases, it become explode. When helium fusion ends the red super giant star evolves into type II supernova. Then neutron star forms.

# The age of universe

The history of physics

Assumption of an infinite and eternal [static universe](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Static_universe) is wrong, proving by the Olbers's paradox.

$$
I=\frac{L}{4\pi x^2}
$$

## Hubble's law

Each star is move away from each other, the universe is expanding, which is one of the evidence of Big Bang theory, v is velocity.

$$
v=Hubble's \ constant \times distance
$$

$$
T=\frac{1}{H_0}
$$

# The fate of the universe

- Flat universe: average density = critical density
- Closed universe: average density > critical density
- Open universe: average density < critical density

The end of universe is only connected with the critical density.

## Dark matter

The matter do not **interact** with light with a high density.

It has very large mass and invisible. So it may affect the fate of universe.

Invisible thing, do not interrupt with the light.

### Gravitational lensing

It can cause the direction changing of the light.

## Dark energy

Can not **interact** with light.

# Distance to the stars

## Trigonometric parallax

Light intensity can be observed.

- The star is viewed from two positions at 6 month **intervals**.
- The change in **angular** position of the star against **backdrop** of fixed stars is measured.
- **Trigonometry** is used to calculate the distance to the star.
- The radius of the Earth's orbit about the Sun must be known.

## Standard candle / Cepheid

A standard candle is a star of known luminosity.

- Idea that distances to stars too far for parallax can be measured
- Observe a **variable** star
- Measure the period of intensity **variation**
- Use a known relationship between period and luminosity to calculate the luminosity of the star
- Measure the intensity, F, of the standard candle
- Use **inverse square** law to calculate the distance of candle

### What if the distance of standard candle is over estimated?

- If Polaris were closer, its luminosity would be less than had been thought.
- Idea that distances to other astronomical bodies would be less than had been thought.
- So the Hubble constant would be **greater** than had been thought.
- As age = $$1/H_0$$, the universe would not be as old as had been thought.

## Doppler method

- Calculate the **wavelength** using observation.
- Calculate the laboratory value.
- Using the doppler equation to calculate the v.
- The **Hubble's** equation can calculate the distance from star to it.

z is red shift.

$$
z=\frac{v}{c}=\frac{\Delta f}{f}=\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}
$$
