# Ideal gas behaviour

## Boyle's law

For a constant mass of gas at a constant **temperature**, the pressure exerted by the gas is **inversely** proportional to the volume it occupies.

## Charles's law

For a constant mass of gas at a constant **pressure**, the volume occupied by the gas is proportional to its **absolute** temperature.

## Pressure law / Gay-Lussac's law

For a constant mass of gas at a constant **volume**. the pressure exerted by the gas is proportional to its **absolute** temperature.

## Ideal gases

$$
pV=nRT \newline
pV=NkT
$$

### Assumptions

- The molecules have negligible **size**.
- The molecules are identical.
- All collisions are perfectly elastic and the time of a collision is significantly smaller than the time between collisions.
- The molecules **exert** no forces on each other except during collisions.
- There are **enough** molecules so that statistics can be applied.
- The motion of the molecules is **random**.

## Why the pressure increase as the energy increase

- Average kinetic energy of molecules is greater.
- Collision **rate** with **walls of container** is greater.
- There is a greater **rate** of change of **momentum**.
- Therefore a greater force on the container walls.
- To keep a balance, the volume increases

## Why we can view the internal energy as all kinetic energy?

- Internal energy is the sum of kinetic and **potential** energy of the (molecules/atoms in the) air.
- The molecules / atoms (in an ideal gas) have **no** potential energy.
- In ideal gas, the **inter-molecular force** can be ignored

# Internal energy

## Molecular kinetic energy

$$
\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>=\frac{3}{2}kT
$$

$$<c^2>$$ is $$\frac{V^2}{n}$$, k is constant.

$$<c^2>$$ is mean square speed. $$\sqrt{<c^2>}$$ is RMST(root-mean-square speed), it shows the average kinetic energy the molecule has.

$$
-273 \degree C=0 Kelvin
$$

# Heat transfer

## Specific latent heat

Internal energy: the sum of kinetic energy and the potential energy.

The ideal gas behaviour presumes there's **no** potential energy in gases, we can say that the formula below shows the **potential energy** changing.

Only for status changing only.

$$
Q=L\Delta m
$$
